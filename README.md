# Binance Chain Tool Box

# Airdrop
 __Disclaimer: Airdrop is very error prone and can cause big financial loss. Please do test it on testnet and use it carefully.__

## Installation
We have a installer script (install.sh) that takes care of chain directory setup. This uses the following defaults:

* Home folder in ~/.bairdrop
* Client executables stored in /usr/local/bin (i.e. bairdrop or tbairdrop)

```
# One-line install
sh <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/binance-chain/chain-tooling/airdrop/install.sh)
```

Note that we have two different binaries: `bairdrop` is used for mainnet and `tbairdrop` for testnet.
